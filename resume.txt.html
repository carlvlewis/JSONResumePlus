			<h3>About</h3>
		</aside>
		<div class="col-sm-9">
			<p>I&#x27;m an interactive/data journalist, civic-tech entrepreneur, newsroom change consultant, part-time digital journalism educator, design thinker, former online editor/social media manager, mobile/front-end designer/developer, interaction programmer, Wordpress/Drupal dev., Stanford-certified project manager and aspiring data scientist, with more than seven years of cumulative experience in interactive storytelling, data visualization, audience engagement, social media/email marketing strategy, web programming, community-building, UX best-practices, digital content production, deadline reporting and digital analytics/social media metrics. Recent skill-sets I&#x27;ve dabbled in include Python, R, data science, statistical modeling and geospatial visualizations, as well as educational technology and digital security.

My overarching goal – whether in journalism, data visualization, information design, marketing, mobile development or, most recently, entrepreneurship – has always been motivated by the goal of building stronger, more informed communities, locally and globally. I&#x27;m an urbanist who believes that diversity, digital transparency, social mobility, civic discourse, an informed public, and communal values are the key to our sustainable future – whether that be in Macon, Ga., or midtown Manhattan. Nothing brings me more joy than teaching and training journalists and employees how to incorporate data into their narratives to help expose hidden stories.</p>

					<p>Carl was a terrific and accomplished participant in the class, &quot;Making the Business of Journalism Work.&quot;   He was super dependable in discussions, always participating and frequently giving an interesting twist.   All of his writing was excellent, having practically perfect papers each time.  At the end of the semester, Carl had a thorough and sophisticated understanding of the principles of the class.    He will be an excellent manager and strategist in any kind of media business that he participates in.</p>

					<p>While Carl was a student at Mercer University, I had the pleasure of working with him on many projects aimed at Macon&#x27;s revitalization.  In general, Mercer University recruits, nurtures and graduates people who are interested in making positive changes in their communities.  Carl exemplified this trait at Mercer, spending time in and out of the classroom improving Macon.  I cannot imagine any non-profit in Macon would be as successful without the support of Mercer and Mercer students.

In particular, I want to recommend Carl&#x27;s work on CollegeTownMacon.com.  Although tens of thousands of college students attend school in Macon, it has been difficult to connect these students with businesses and activities in the community.  We want students to see Macon as their college experience, and not just their specific campus.  Carl led a 200-level class in Civic and Community Journalism to build a website to provide an online directory for local experiences for College students to solve this problem.  The entire course was built around the production of this website, making Carl largely responsible for the syllabus, including organizing and assigning tasks and research, providing instruction and training for technical, interview and writing skills, managing work flow, editing content and ensuring the timely completion of tasks.  Carl&#x27;s management skills in this course brought together two of his best skills: teaching and project management.  

By the end of the course, Carl&#x27;s class delivered a functional website that led a cultural shift among college students in Macon that has had a long-term impact in Macon with more students involved in the community and driving economic development.  Carl taught students new skills and then helped those students apply those skills to solve real world problems and have a positive impact in the community.  That&#x27;s an accomplishment that many seasoned instructors struggle to achieve.  </p>

					<p>I&#x27;ve known Carl since he was arguably the brightest student in his university journalism program. Since then he has gone on to be the in house innovator everywhere he has been. Carl not only understands where digital journalism needs to be today, he is also thinking about where it needs to go next and how he can help get it there. Every newsroom needs a Carl.</p>

					<p>During his senior year of college, Carl V. helped me make a long-held dream come true by almost single-handedly conceiving, building and launching the website for The Cluster. Carl V. and I started the conversation about the website in class, and I immediately knew that I had finally found someone who had the skills and drive to make my goal of bringing the newspaper online a reality. Within a month of our initial conversation, Carl had built an easy to use platform, based on Wordpress, for the website. Of our staff of 10 editors, few had experience using Wordpress, and Carl was able to quickly train the editors and myself on posting to and updating the website. He also wrote up documentation for the editors to reference in case they needed help, which allowed them and Carl to use their time more efficiently. The website launched in late February 2011, too late for entry into the Georgia College Press Association awards, but the website that Carl built won 1st place in the &quot;Best Website&quot; category the following year. Three years later, the website is still running smoothly, which is largely thanks to the extensive manual that Carl developed and left with my successor. Thanks to his effort, The Cluster is now available online and on a mobile app. Carl is able to patiently and efficiently teach new skills to others, and his passion for his work shows through. </p>

					<p>For almost a year-and-a-half, I had the rewarding opportunity to work under Carl’s leadership during his time as Digital Media Manager and Online Editor for the Savannah Morning News and savannahnow.com. 
 
During his tenure, Carl reinvigorated my journalistic efforts as an online content producer with hands-on web training, valuable expertise and knowledge of current media trends and exemplary practices for enhancing storytelling and audience engagement.
 
He is a fierce team leader, a thorough communicator and an exceptional motivator, often instilling confidence in me when I didn’t think I could accomplish advanced digital tasks on my own. His strengths as an instructor helped me to master web and mobile app development, data visualization and other interactive tools to produce more effective story packages and creative content.
 
Carl also lobbied for opportunities that would allow his team members to gain professional development and greater exposure in the journalism industry. Most notably, in October 2013, I traveled with him to the Online News Association conference in Atlanta where we joined highly engaged digital professionals to discuss tools and techniques advancing the value of news media. It was my first time networking with leading digital journalists from around the country. 

Carl’s time at the Savannah Morning News tremendously altered the newsroom’s collective approach to digital practices. Even after his employment, he still readily and generously offers consultation, advice and support in any of our company’s endeavors. We continue to value his passionate work ethics and eagerness to teach, and our team is significantly better because of his contributions.</p>

					<p>Carl set the bar for news reporting at the Oxford Student, where I had the good fortune of working with him as an editor. He was the model of a dedicated, tenacious reporter, bringing intelligence and a craftsman’s passion to every story. Carl innovated too, pitching and executing a successful redesign of the paper’s website. And working with him was a joy on a personal level – he made quite a splash in our stolid British student newsroom. We often held up Carl’s work as an exemplar after he left Oxford. I am sure he will inspire future colleagues too.</p>

					<p>Even when Carl was a collegiate intern at The Telegraph, he blew us away with his skills. We would have loved to have him join our staff and have been jealous of Savannah for snatching him away. I can only imagine how much more valuable he is now!</p>

					<p>Carl is a terrific digital mind. He has proven his fluency in several critical web development languages - HTML5, CSS, Javascript and PHP - and he uses those skills to craft engaging, intuitive digital projects.

Better still, Carl is fully capable of disseminating his knowledge to his team and coworkers. He is no closet-and-dark-room developer; he can lead a team from concept to finished project.

And like any good journalist, he&#x27;s detail oriented and deadline driven.</p>

					<p>I was privileged to work with Carl on several collaborative social media projects during his time with the Savannah Morning News. His innovative ideas and technical skills played an integral role in how information was communicated at key events in Savannah for visitors such as the 189th St. Patrick&#x27;s Day Parade and Festival. 

Carl developed digital systems to establish a central calendar and revamped website and smartphone app for DoSavannah that put the Savannah Morning News on the map as a trusted resource for mainstream and alt events in the area that appealed to locals and visitors. 

Carl&#x27;s ability to complete projects under tight deadlines and keep a positive attitude made him an enjoyable partner to work with and I enjoyed collaborating on special projects and promotions with him!</p>

					<p>Working with Carl is pure joy...he&#x27;s on top of his digital game no doubt, but he brings his special brand of humor and wit to bear on the marketing and branding department. Carl will thrive in an entrepreneurial environment,  wearing multiple hats. He&#x27;s enthusiastic about &quot;big data&quot; and tackling complex problems. He&#x27;s as comfortable working with a team as he is contributing to projects from his own corner of the world.  If you&#x27;re looking for someone who brings a fresh outlook to his work, who is constantly evolving, and who is passionate about building a quality digital experience, look no further than Carl V. Lewis.</p>
